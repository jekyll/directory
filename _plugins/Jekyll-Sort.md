description: >
  For those of you who have some list and want to sort it in jekyll, this
  plugin will sort lists of primitives and lists of hashes based on a
  direction and what to sort on (if needed). It stores the sorted answer in
  the global site var for usage. If you have lists of hashes of hashes and
  you want to sort on something deeper than the first level, then you can
  edit this code.
