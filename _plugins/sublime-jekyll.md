  [A Sublime Text package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll) for Jekyll static sites

  This package is aimed at streamlining the process of managing and creating new Jekyll posts.
  It does this by providing quick and easy access to new post and draft commands, snippets and
  completions for Liquid template tags and filters, as well as some handy commands for adding
  dates and upload links to your posts.

  If you use Jekyll as your static site generator, and Sublime Text as your text editor, you
  should absolutely install and use this package!
