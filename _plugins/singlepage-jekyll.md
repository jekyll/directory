  A simple Jekyll plugin to make content load dynamically using pagify.js.

  Pagify.js is a great jQuery plugin to make simple one-page websites, with
  content loading dynamically. The only problem with it is that you have to
  define every page you want to load manually. This is fine for a static
  page, but it get's in the way when you're hosting a website with
  regularly updated content. This plugin aims to solve that.

  It generates a JSON file of all your pages, which you can pass to
  pagify.js.
